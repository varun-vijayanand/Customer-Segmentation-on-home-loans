# Customer Segmentation on Home Loans
This project involves analysing a home loans dataset to identify high-default clusters among customers. We will begin by performing EDA on the dataset, 
before performing clustering to identify customer segments, and concluding our findings.

### Summary
- Obtained dataset from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/gavincanacam/home-loan-predictions).
- Performed EDA & imputed missing values using similar entries.
- Used k-means clustering to identify clusters with different default risks.
- Identified optimal k value using elbow method & silhouette score.
- Obtained a cluster with 80% good loans & explored its characteristics.
